//! This crate defines a Public Preview Temporal Rust SDK.
//!
//! The SDK is built on top of Core and provides a native Rust experience for writing Temporal
//! Workflows and Activities.
//!
//! The SDK is in Public Preview and under active development. The API can and will continue to evolve.
//!
//! An example of running an activity worker:
//! ```no_run

//!     activities::{ActivityContext, ActivityError},
//! };
//!
//! struct MyActivities;

//! #[activities]
//! impl MyActivities {
//!     #[activity]
